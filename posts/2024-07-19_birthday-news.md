## The First TerpScoop

Almsot 10 years ago, my roommate and I bought a 3D printer and started printing every file we could find. We had tons of fails, but we learned a lot about how to design and print models. One of those broken 3D prints was a miniature catapult, the broken basket of which would later become the very first TerpScoop.

## TerpScoops Today

Last April, I made the decision to buy another 3D printer and start printing scoops for sale. I sold my first jars to the dispensary I work at and got amazing feedback from all the customers who bought one. This April, I launched the TerpScoop website officially and attended my first trade show at CU Boulder with the CannaBuffs. At this event I connected with Matt from [TokerPoker](https://www.tokerpoker.com/) and he gave me some great advice on how to get my scoops off the ground.

## What's Next for TerpScoops

In about a week, I'll be receiving the first production shipment of TerpScoops. This first batch of 25,000 scoops encapsulates 6+ months of hard work and I'm so excited to get them all across the US soon! With 1000 jars to sell, my work is cut out for me, but I plan on getting them all sold by the end of the year.

Along with these scoops, I created countless stickers, cards, logos and even a [fun new t-shirt design](https://shop.terpscoops.com/products/terpz-t-shirt). The business was starting to feel more and more real so I trademarked the name TerpScoops and even got a patent pending on the design. I'm so excited to see the reaction to all of my designs and products and I can't wait to see them out in the wild.

## What's Next for Terpmetrix & Me

I'm so excited to see how much I can get done before 2025. I'm planning a couple road trips to visit dispensaries and headshops across the US to stock those shelves, east coast first, then headed west before the holidays. Overall, I have 3 goals for the rest of 2024:

- Sell all 1000 jars of scoops
- Get TerpScoops in every legal state
- Launch a software product in the cannabis space
- Turn a profit ü•¥

## Thank You

I'm so grateful for all of the support I've received in the past year. I couldn't have done it without the help of my friends, family, and the amazing community of stoners I've met along the way. I can't wait to see what the future holds for TerpScoops and Terpmetrix. *Happy scooping!* üåøüç®
