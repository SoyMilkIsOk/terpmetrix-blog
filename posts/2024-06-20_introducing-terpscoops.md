## Wtf is a TerpScoop?

The TerpScoop is a revolutionary new way to scoop your herbs. No more stickiness, no more mess, no more waste. The perfect companion for any grinder, TerpScoops are designed to help you get the perfect dose every time.

## Why TerpScoops? 

We saw a gap in the market for a product that could help people to dose their herbs more accurately, and we knew we could fill it. So we set out to create a product that would be easy to use, quick to clean, and convenient to store. And that's exactly what we did.

### Problems we tried to solve

- **Messy**: Traditional dosing methods can be messy, with herbs sticking to your fingers and spilling everywhere.
- **Inaccurate**: It can be difficult to get an accurate dose using traditional methods, leading to waste and inconsistency.
- **Expensive**: Other grinder tools on the market currently are too expensive, usually costing upwards of $10 each!
- **Poor design**: Lack the ergonomics and design elements we look for in a product we use daily.

### How TerpScoops solves them

- **Clean**: The TerpScoop is made from acrylic resin, it won't scratch your grinder and is super easy to clean.
- **Accurate**: The TerpScoop is designed to hold a specific amount of herbs (one pinch or ~1/4 tspb), so you can be sure you're getting the perfect dose every time.
- **Affordable**: We're selling TerpScoops for just $4.20 in-store and even cheaper online, so you can get one for you and all your friends if you want!
- **Ergonomic**: The TerpScoop is designed to be comfortable to hold while still small enough to fit in most grinders, so you can scoop your herbs with ease.
